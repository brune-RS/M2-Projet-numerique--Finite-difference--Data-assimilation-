# Numerical project: Finite difference and Data assimilation applied to heat diffusion in soil
## M2 Climatic System: Atmophere, Hydrosphere, Cryosphere (Universit√© Grenoble Alpes) - January 2023
### Brune RAYNAUD--SCHELL tutored by Emmanuel COSME (IGE)



Here are all the scripts, functions used during my project and those that allowed me to illustrate my results 

- **RAYNAUD--SCHEL_Brune....pdf**: Pdf file of the report 

- **Functions_Data_assim.py:** Library with all the functions created and used in the script (Data assimilation part) 
- **Functions_Finite_Difference.py:** Library with all the functions created and used in the script (Finite Difference part) 

### Scripts in the form of Python jupyter notebooks:

- **Finite difference.ipynb:**  Implementation of different finite difference schemes to model heat diffusion in the ground and compare their accuracy and precision
- **Model_background.ipynb:** Implementation of more realistic boundary conditions (periodic cycle of temperature at the surface)
- **Obs + 3D VAR:**  Made up data set reprensenting in-situ measurements of temperature in the ground + Implementation of 3D VAR a data assimilation method to improve the model using observations
